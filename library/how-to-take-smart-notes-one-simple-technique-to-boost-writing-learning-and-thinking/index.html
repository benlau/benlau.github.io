<p>we experience what Allen calls a “mind like water” -</p>

<p>The other reason is that GTD requires projects to be broken down into smaller, concrete “next steps.”</p>

<p>Writing is not a linear process. We constantly have to jump back and forth between different tasks. It wouldn’t make any sense to micromanage ourselves on that level.</p>

<p>we need a note- taking system that is as comprehensive as GTD,</p>

<p>but made a transition from one context to another. It was very much like a translation where you use different words that fit a different context, but strive to keep the original meaning as truthfully as possible.</p>

<p>You need something to capture ideas whenever and wherever they pop into your head. Whatever you use, it should not require any thoughts, attention or multiple steps to write it down. It can be a notebook, a napkin, an app on your phone or iPad. These</p>
<p>THE FOUR UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES</p>

<p>Under which topic do I store this note? In the new system, the question is: In which context will I want to stumble upon it again?</p>
<p>Highlight (pink) - 6 Simplicity Is Paramount &gt; Page 52</p>
<p>Instead of having different storage for different ideas, everything goes into the same slip- box and is standardised into the same format. Instead of focusing on the in- between steps and trying to make a science out of underlining systems, reading techniques or excerpt writing, everything is streamlined towards one thing only: insight that can be published.</p>
<p>Highlight (pink) - 6 Simplicity Is Paramount &gt; Page 53</p>
<p>Fleeting notes, which are only reminders of information, can be written in any kind of way and will end up in the trash within a day or two.</p>
<p>Highlight (blue) - 6 Simplicity Is Paramount &gt; Page 53</p>
<p>Permanent notes, which will never be thrown away and contain the necessary information in a permanently understandable way.</p>

<p>Project notes, which are only relevant to one particular project. They are kept within a project- specific folder and can be discarded or archived after the project is finished.</p>

<p>Fleeting notes are there for capturing ideas quickly while you are busy doing something else.</p>

<p>quick note is the best you can do without interrupting what you are in the middle of doing.</p>
<p>Highlight (blue) - 6 Simplicity Is Paramount &gt; Page 55</p>
<p>Fleeting notes are only useful if you review them within a day or so and turn them into proper notes you can use later. Fleeting</p>

<p>Most ideas will not stand the test of time,</p>
<p>Highlight (blue) - 6 Simplicity Is Paramount &gt; Page 55</p>
<p>while others might become the seed for a major project. Unfortunately,</p>
<p>Highlight (blue) - 6 Simplicity Is Paramount &gt; Page 56</p>
<p>never underlined sentences in the text he read or wrote comments in the margins. All he did was take brief notes about the ideas that caught his attention in a text on a separate piece of paper: “I make a note with the bibliographic details. On the backside I would write ‘on page x is this, on page y is that,’ and then it goes into the bibliographic slip- box where I collect everything I read.” (Hagen,</p>
<p>Highlight (blue) - 6 Simplicity Is Paramount &gt; Page 57</p>
<p>Project- related notes can be:• comments in the manuscript• collections of project- related literature• outlines• snippets of drafts• reminders• to- do lists• and of course the draft itself.</p>

<p>In order to develop a good question to write about or find the best angle for an assignment,</p>

<p>writing is not a linear process, but a circular one:</p>
<p>Highlight (blue) - 7 Nobody Ever Starts From Scratch &gt; Page 63</p>
<p>Even though academic writing is not a linear process, that does not mean you should follow an anything- goes approach. On the contrary, a clear, reliable structure is paramount.</p>
